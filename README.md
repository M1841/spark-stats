# Spark Stats - version 0.3.0

## Description

Spark Stats is project that's been on my mind for a while. I've kept postponing it because I wanted it to be perfect and I wanted to learn everything I'd need to know before starting it, but I've ultimately decided that learning as I go is the best way to go about it. The intent is to build a Spotify companion app that will allow you to see your stats and compare them with your friends, offer library management features such as playlist shuffling, duplicate removal and more.
